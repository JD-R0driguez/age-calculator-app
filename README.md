## Overview

The Age Calculator is a user-friendly web application that allows users to calculate their age based on their birthdate. It provides an intuitive interface where users can input their birth day, month, and year, and instantly get their age in years, months, and days. The application validates the user input to ensure it is within the acceptable range and provides real-time age calculation.


### Features

- User-friendly interface: The Age Calculator has a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to input their birthdate and view the calculated age.

- Real-time validation: The application validates the input fields in real-time to ensure that the entered values are valid. It checks for valid day and month values and prevents the selection of future years.

- Error handling: If the user enters an invalid date or leaves any of the required fields empty, appropriate error messages are displayed to guide them towards entering valid information.

- Automatic age calculation: Upon entering a valid birthdate, the Age Calculator automatically calculates the user's age in years, months, and days, based on the current date. The calculated age is displayed in real-time.

- Responsive design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent user experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
